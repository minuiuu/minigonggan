                In these days, many coffee lovers and companies are interested in protecting environment and making an effort in their own way. Representative one is to use reusable cup. Collecting tumblers of large companies has become the latest trend in Korea. However, other environmental problems such as greenhouse gas emissions occurs as the production of reusable cup is growing. This project is to empower consumers helping them understand how their actions impact the envrionment by monitoring of their frootprint.

            Today, the ideology of consumerism seems utterly dominant in developed socities. People keep consuming products and services even though they do not need it. It has become easier to consume almost everything with just clicking the button online. This project was the UX of convenience. I was allowed to design a way to address the negative impacts of convenience consumerism.

            I approached this project from doing diary studies and exploring my consumerism. I found that I consume coffee a lot and narrowed down my resarch to consumering coffee. While research about coffee, I observed Korean people were participating the environmental campaign and were crazy at receiving the reward which was plastic reusable cup. It inspried me to do further research.

                Most Korean people have portable reusable cups and they have dirverse products with different uses such as hot/cold drink. They try to bring their own cups when they go out in order to protect environment and to get incentives, but it is hard and tiresome for them to take them in busy morning. Collecting famous franchise cafes’ tumblers became a trend for yourger people. Most of them first experienced using tumbler through buying for following trend or present. Brand image is important and people want some unique, special and limited items, and accrordignly cups are re-sold with higher price.

        <div class="insight-text">Starbucks Korea, which has the largest number of stores in the world, has a very high participation rate of Koreans in its annual environmental campaign. They often give a reusable cup if they participate within a certain period of time. However, young Koreans are sensitive to trends and limited sales, so they focus on receiving cups rather than environmental protection. I think good changes will be possible if good intentions are informed to people on a regular basis, not on a temporary basis.</div>
