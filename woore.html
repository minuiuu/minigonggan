            This project is a self-directed design project on a topic of I chose. In this project, design was used as a tool for inquiry and research.

I approached this project from deciding neotribe in South Korea since I was in Korea and it was easier and getable for me to conduct research. I chose Korean who are willing to adopt dogs as my neotribe. After that, I was able to explore deeply in order to choose my topic. My idea and process had developed while I had workshop to my neotribe with toolkit through RTD(research through design).

        <div class="w-text">I ran the online workshop for 3 times through Miro board. There were 4 activities and interview on workshop, and it ran about 30-45 minutes. 2 activities were about normal dogs participants think and imagine. Other activities were about stray dogs. I got 6 records and documented the full particulars on the Notion. While running workshop, I found that there were many problems about adopting stray dogs. Most participants wanted to adopt and raise dogs but they do not have enough information for adoption. And there was no one who do not have prejudice of stray dogs. Each workshop had improved because of the communication(interveiw) with each participant. It was able to get sincere answer through interview.   </div>

        <div class="insight-text">Koreans usually adopt dogs through acquaintances and pet shops. The adoption rate of abandoned dogs was significantly low, and there were many negative perceptions of stray dogs in workshops as well. People did not know the complicated adoption process. And they have many prejudices that stray dogs may have been abandoned due to disease and old age. However, there are many types of dogs in shelter. In addition, depending on the trend, many purebred dogs are abandoned. People are not aware of the application for adopting stray dogs, and do not like the website because of bad UI/UX.</div>

It aims to increase the accessibility of abandoned dog adoption and to give a sense of trust by engaging in adoption, and further improve the image of abandoned dogs as sick and dirty.</div>
